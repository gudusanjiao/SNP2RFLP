## Installation and operating environments for VCF-kit (important!)
To prepare for installing VCF-kit, make sure system has pip and anaconda installed ahead. 
If new users do not have these two tools installed, you can refer to: [title](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
and [title](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) to get instructions for installation.
